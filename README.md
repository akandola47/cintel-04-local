 CC4.1: Orient and Engage (Professional Tools, Install Python)

To get started with Python and PyShiny, we have used them in the browser and used GitHub repos to store our code (via copy & paste). But we generally don't build real apps that way. Most data analytics work is done on your own machine or using proprietary cloud services. Information is a competitive benefit and not always done in public.  

In this module, we switch to local development on our own machine. There are many benefits, but it's a little bit of work. There are things to install, and tools to configure, and of course, learning how to use them. In this course, the tools are not the focus. Just follow the instructions carefully. The foundations are covered much more in 44-608 Data Analytics Fundamentals.

This module covers installing Python, and installing tools for editing code (VS Code) and for keeping our GitHub project repo synchronized with the corresponding project repo on our machine (Git).  

We apologize in advance, it's not always fun, but the tools are powerful - it's worth it - and those of us that have been there can sympathize and help. The good news is when you learn Git at school, everything is replaceable. You'll feel more comfortable using these tools at work (when it really matters).
